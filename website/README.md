Online VS Platform
================

Now we start the website part of the Online AI Versus platform. Not a very good idea to do such thing in exam preparation month.

Introduction
------------

To have a quick start-off, I will use the unstable version of Yii Framework 2.0 . Don't worry it won't mess things up.

Practice
------------

The testing function of the framework is still buggy so I will not TDD this time. Can't wait to try CodeCeption next time.

Development
-----------

Alright there doesn't seen to be a team to work with. I will have fun myself.
